# Contributing Guidlines

Feel free to contribute. I am always looking for interesting PRs. There are just some general guidelines you should stick to:

* Don't add any additional dependencies
* You agree with contributing according to the Apache 2.0 license
* Your code should compile and pass `go vet`
